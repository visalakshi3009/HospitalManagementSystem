The Hospital Management System is a Java-based software application designed to streamline
hospital operations using a modular and object-oriented approach. It automates key tasks such as
patient registration, scheduling appointments with doctors, resource allocation, and bed management, effectively
addressing common challenges in healthcare facilities.

This system facilitates the management of appointments, critical cases, and resources like beds
and medical supplies. With a user-friendly, menu-driven interface, it separates actions for doctors
and patients, promoting efficient interactions. Exception handling ensures data integrity and
smooth operation, making the system robust and adaptable to various hospital needs. 

The system provides a centralized platform that
facilitates:
1. Patient Registration and Consultation: Patients can register in the system, access
personalized schemes, and consult with doctors. The system also allows patients to receive
updates on available services, including treatment options and remote monitoring
capabilities.
2. Real-Time Resource Tracking: The HMS offers real-time information on doctor
availability, bed occupancy, and essential medical supplies, supporting timely and informed
decision-making for both patients and hospital staff.
3. Doctor-Patient Communication: The system establishes a two-way communication
channel between patients and doctors, enabling remote consultations and support. This
feature is particularly useful for elderly patients or emergencies where immediate advice is
required.
4. Monitoring and Reporting: The HMS allows the hospital to track patient conditions,
manage critical cases, and respond efficiently to emergencies. It also provides data that can
be used for generating reports, aiding hospital administrators in data-driven decision-
making.
